This is my personal nvim configuration. It is not meant to be used by others, but feel free to do so.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `.config` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/lpsouza/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim/
```

## Thanks

This respository is inspired by ideias from @josean-dev on you repository [dev-environment-files](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files).
